# Volatility Surface VAE

This code base is for the following paper:

Jacky Chen, John Hull, Zissis Poulos, Haris Rasul, Andreas Veneris, Yuntao Wu, "*A Variational Autoencoder Approach to Conditional Generation of Possible Future Volatility Surfaces*", to appear in The Journal of Financial Data Science, 2025.

We use CVAE + LSTM to generate volatility surfaces based on an arbitrary context length.

## data_preproc

This folder contains all the code for data cleaning/generation.
- `data_preproc.py`:
    - cleaning up the data downloaded from WRDS
    - generating 5x5 volatility surface grid (moneyness x time to maturity)
    - The usage can be found in `spx_volsurface_generation.ipynb` and `spx_convert_to_grid.ipynb`.
    - **Note:** We might need to download the S&P500 stock prices from yahoo finance, using ticker `^GSPC`.
- `sabr_gen.py`:
    - For SABR volatility surface grid (K/S moneyness x time to maturity) generation (Appendix C)
    - The usage can be found in `sabr_volsurface.ipynb`

To preprocess the data, use the following two files in the main directory:
- `spx_volsurface_generation.ipynb`: This uses the `data_preproc.py`, cleans the data and generates a dataframe containing the interpolated IVS data.
- `spx_convert_to_grid.ipynb`: This converts the dataframe generated by `spx_volsurface_generation.ipynb` to create the 5x5 numpy grid.

## eval_scripts

This folder contains code for generating distributions of surfaces for single day and multiple days and relevant evaluation functions, such as histogram plotting and latent manipulation.

## vae

This folder contains all the code for VAE definitions.
- `base`: the base VAE, encoder and decoder classes
- `dense_vae`: VAE that flattens the input and treat everything as 1D vector
- `conv_vae`: VAE that uses 2D convolutional layers for encoder and decoder
- `cvae`: conditional VAE that uses Conv2D/Linear layers for encoder and decoder
- `cvae_with_mem`: cvae but with memory added, can use LSTM, GRU, RNN. Default LSTM.
- `cvae_with_mem_randomized`: same as `cvae_with_mem`, but with variable context length and generate 1 day forward. Used in the current paper.

Other codes:
- `datasets`: the customized dataset definitions used for the models. The classes with `__getitem__` returning a dictionary is currently used.
- `datasets_randomized`: the customized dataset definitions used for `cvae_with_mem_randomized`, generates data points with variable context length. 
- `utils`: code used for setting random seeds, training, testing and evaluation.

## Training and Surface generation
- `param_search.py` can be used to search for optimal parameters and train the models
- `generate_surfaces.py` can be used to generate distributions of surfaces over a time horizon
- `generate_surfaces_max_likelihood.py` can be used to generate the surfaces with maximum likelihood (encoded latent with zero for generated date)

## Table/Plot generation
The following files contains the code for table and plot generation for the final paper:
- `main_analysis.py`

Detailed implementations are in `analysis_code`.
